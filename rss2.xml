      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I have finally decided to start my exchange “diary” (which is rather like an exchange blog) before I return from <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/India" target="_blank" rel="external">India</a> (my exchange country) back to my home country, <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Slovakia" target="_blank" rel="external">Slovakia</a>.<br>As an exchange student, I have made <strong>two</strong> major mistakes, which I really want you as the future exchange students to be aware of, because they’re crucial to your exchange experience, memories and general success of your exchange. Let me describe you these points little more.</p>
<h2 id="A_diary"><a href="#A_diary" class="headerlink" title="A diary"></a>A diary</h2><p>What I regret the most, and what no sane exchange student should forget, or be lazy to do, is to take a paper diary. Firstly, when you arrive to your host country, it will feel like Alice, when she explores Wonderland for her first time. <em>Everything</em> will be very new and exciting to you, you will gain lots and lots of experience and possess constant happiness. Unfortunately, your memories of those days won’t last for very long time, because there will be constantly arriving new experiences and discoveries to you. During that time, if you don’t take a diary, íf you don’t write down everything you have seen or discovered immediately or at least you don’t sit in the evening to make a romance-size note about your lovely passed day, your memories will be lost, or in the best case, blurred.</p>
<p>I went for my exchange irresponsibly, if not punishably, unprepared, and after coming to India I was so excited I haven’t even <em>thought</em> of taking a diary.</p>
<ul>
<li>So the very first rule: Whatever the experience you get in the first months of your exchange, please <strong>take down a note of everything</strong>, whatever happens to you, so you will not lose your most important life memories and won’t be regretting it later.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Lots_of_photos"><a href="#Lots_of_photos" class="headerlink" title="Lots of photos"></a>Lots of photos</h2><p>Another thing is, kinda technical issue in my case, that I had not used my money in the right way before going to India, and thus I went for my exchange absolutely <em>technicaly unprepared</em> – with me I have had only a shitty old phone which was constantly dying, and didn’t have a good built-in camera. Because of that, I wasn’t really much interested in taking photos, since most of those were ugly, blurred or dark; or, in the best situations, I couldn’t take any photos, because the phone was dead. So haven’t taken any photos nor did I take down my experiences in a diary. What a hammer.</p>
<ul>
<li>The second rule is clear: No electronics you get before going on your exchange are worth more than <strong>a good quality photocamera</strong>, or at least a smartphone provided it has got a good camera. (Obviously, you gotta have an interest in taking photos of everything around you, in the first place; but exchange will take care of keeping you interested :-).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Conclusion__28TL_3BDR_29"><a href="#Conclusion__28TL_3BDR_29" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion (TL;DR)"></a>Conclusion (TL;DR)</h2><p>Exchange is the most valuable experience in your life. Nothing is more valuable: passing upto the college with _A_s nor your first <em>sex</em>. You will understand this once you’re <em>on</em> and <em>back</em> from your exchange. <em>Exchange is not a year in your life, it is a life in one year</em>. So, do not waste your one-year lifetime, it is too unique and you will never have an opportunity to do it again.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Take an exchange <strong>diary</strong></em>, write down your detailed feelings and experiences,</li>
<li><em>Take a lot of photos <strong>while you find things around you interesting</strong>.</em> After a half year of your exchange passes, everything around you will become absolutely normal to you, so you will not be interested in taking photos anymore.</li>
<li><em>Adjust</em> to the culture &amp; <em>enjoy</em> your exchange!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Ad_E9l_u2019s_experiences"><a href="#Ad_E9l_u2019s_experiences" class="headerlink" title="Adél’s experiences"></a>Adél’s experiences</h2><p>This year there’s one more fellow exchange student of mine in India – her name is Adél Havlová and she is from our neighbor country, <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Czech+Republic" target="_blank" rel="external">Czech Republic</a>. She’s got a really nice long-term blog about her exchange experiences since she reached India and she frequently posts her experiences in <strong>czech language</strong>. If you’re interested, here’s the link:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rokvindii.blog.cz/" target="_blank" rel="external">Adél Havlová – Rok v Indii</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks and hope you will have an awesome exchange life!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><code>went-sleep.php</code> is a little utility written in PHP, which is supposed to <strong>help me with going regularly early to sleep</strong><br>during the extraordinary days (those are, at least for me, mostly when I write some code which I am totally excited<br>with, so it happens to me that I am finishing and further improving it long to the night – often till 2 am or 3 am).</p>
<h2 id="Busy_mind_doesn_u2019t_allow_you_sleep"><a href="#Busy_mind_doesn_u2019t_allow_you_sleep" class="headerlink" title="Busy mind doesn’t allow you sleep"></a>Busy mind doesn’t allow you sleep</h2><p>Running <code>went-sleep.php</code> should be the last thing, except brushing your teeth and tidying away the computer, which is<br>done before you go to sleep. Why? If you were doing something long to the night, you (and your mind) got pretty<br>engaged into it. So now even if you switch off the lights, lie in the bed and close your eyes, your mind will stay busy<br><strong>collecting and ordering the information about what you just right now finished doing.</strong> So you won’t be able to sleep<br>and you will keep getting thoughts about how to improve the stuff you have just finished and, what’s worse, you will<br>actively start thinking and participate in solving the ideas in these thoughts! </p>
<p>That’s when you should run <code>went-sleep.php</code>. You will issue a simple command (<code>went-sleep.php</code>), which you should type<br>to the console yourself – to strenghten your whole concentration to it. The command runs and greets you a <em>Goodnight</em>.</p>
<p>Now that your mind is fully concentrated on what you’ve just done (this time running a simple command), it can<br>easily sort it out and then switch to <em>passive mode</em> (that’s when you’re sleeping; your mind keeps sorting the earlier<br>information from that day but without thoughts).</p>
<h2 id="Running_it"><a href="#Running_it" class="headerlink" title="Running it"></a>Running it</h2><p>Running <code>went-sleep.php</code> is as simple as running it itself:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ ~/went-sleep.php</span><br><span class="line">Dark and quite night... Pretty good time to sleep!</span><br><span class="line">Goodnight!</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This simple piece of code records <strong>current UNIX timestamp</strong> at the time of running, which includes current date &amp; time;<br><strong>current timezone</strong> (you can also specify the timezone yourself in the config file, but about that later)<br>and the <strong>current goal</strong> for this day, which is just the time you wanted to regularly get to bed.<br>However, the goal is most often the same, so you can just set it in the config.</p>
<p>If you need to add an exception to the time you aim go to sleep for a particular day, just add the <code>--goal</code> arg: </p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ ~/went-sleep.php --goal <span class="number">12</span>am</span><br><span class="line">So much later today... Sleep well!</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h3 id="Getting_overview"><a href="#Getting_overview" class="headerlink" title="Getting overview"></a>Getting overview</h3><p>Yet the <code>went-sleep.php</code> script has implemented one convenient way of presenting the recorded data – visualising<br>them in an ASCII graph. You just run:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ ~/went-sleep.php --at</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>…and it will show you how much did you achieve your goals overtime.</p>
<h2 id="Configuration"><a href="#Configuration" class="headerlink" title="Configuration"></a>Configuration</h2><p><code>went-sleep.php</code>‘s configuration is stored in the <code>went-sleep.ini</code> file in the same directory as the script.<br>By default it looks like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight ini"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="title">[went-sleep]</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="setting">timezone=</span><br><span class="line"><span class="value">goal=<span class="number">11</span>pm</span></span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This is what <code>went-sleep.php</code> has bundled in it. You can export the default config to file using <code>--confgen</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ ~/went-sleep.php --confgen</span><br><span class="line">Configuration defaults successfully exported to a new file ~/went-sleep.ini</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="So_where_u2019s_it_3F"><a href="#So_where_u2019s_it_3F" class="headerlink" title="So where’s it?"></a>So where’s it?</h2><p>Yet only in my dreams. :-<em>)</em> But soon I will get it to work, promise.</p>
